# Learning Log & Technical Notes

This repository documents my technical learning series. It serves as a living archive of findings, summaries, and code experiments as I deep dive into specific engineering topics.

## Repository Organization

I will organize topics into numbered modules to maintain a logical progression.

### [python](./python/)
* **Core Topic:** Mastery of idiomatic Python ("Pythonic" code).
* **Sub-modules:**
    * `python-tricks`: Summaries and actionable takeaways from *Python Tricks: The Book*.

*(Future topics will be added as new numbered directories.)*

## Format Standards
* **Concepts:** Captured in **Markdown** (`.md`) for readability and easy diffing.
* **Code:** Python examples and experiments will be stored in `.py` scripts or notebooks where relevant.
